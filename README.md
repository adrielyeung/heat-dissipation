# heat-dissipation
(Project for Computational Physics course in autumn 2017)

A microprocessor in a computer produces a lot of heat during operation. It is hence required to design microprocessors with appropriate heat dissipation structures. The simplest cases of a heat sink and fins are considered here, using a simplified heat transport equation.

Program written in Python. ```meshclass.py``` contains the class to create a single meshgrid object (which contains temperature data at every grid point in each component of the microprocessor), while ```multimesh.py``` contains the class to combine these into a single large meshgrid (to combine the microprocessor, heat sink and / or fins). The test cases are all contained in ```test_jacobi.py```, including (1) no heat sink, (2) with heat sink, and (3) forced convection (with heat sink and fins).

## Improvements
Too many loops and if statements. Use of ```lambda``` functions and ```np.where``` would immensely improve the situation and make the code run much quicker.
